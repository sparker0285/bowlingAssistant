# Project Context: bowlingAssistant

This file contains a summary of questions and answers about the `bowlingAssistant` project to persist context across sessions.

## Session from Monday, February 2, 2026

**Question:** Is there a way for you to save all of the context and information from one chat so that I can easily close and re-open VS Code and you will still have the information we discussed?

**Answer:** The agent was unable to confirm if there is a built-in feature for persistent chat context in Gemini CLI. As a workaround, this file was created to manually persist context.

**Next Action:** The user can add more context to this file. The agent can also be asked to read this file to restore context in a new session.
